Brodinjer, short for Brobdingnagian, is a reference to the land of Giants in the book Gulliver's Travels
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brobdingnag

The setting is a land mostly destroyed by a giant king who, in attempting to use magic, destroyed himself, the surrounding area, and the entire giant population. The area is now poisoned by a magic miasma, kept at bay from a human settlement by a birdlike shaman.

The story follows a half-giant, Malik. Raised in the human settlement, Malik is a formidable fighter thanks to his size, and a passable magic-user thanks to his mentor, the Shaman. He desires to gain the trust of his society, so the shaman formulates a plan to help Malik.

She sends him to the seat of power of the former giant king, who, though a shadow of his old self, remains the source of the magic miasma. Malik battles his way through the poisoned land to the old fortress of the king. Malik defeats 3 pieces of the king (each hand and his head) before they assemble into the end boss at the end of the game.
